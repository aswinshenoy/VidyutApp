                        With an army of personnel from the Engineering, Management, Arts
                        and Sciences, Ayurveda and Bio-Tech, Vidyut is a fest like no other.
                        With all hands-on deck working non-stop, there’s not one man who
                        isn’t part of the reason behind the flourishing existence of Vidyut.
                        We are all one and the same and have the same goal in our mind and
                        soul - to take our little multi-fest to heights achieved by no
                        other and to set an example for all. With a plethora of fun and
                        plays happening and nothing being held back on the planning of
                        intellectually stimulating events and activities that’ll undoubtedly
                        improve our brain quality, there is nothing that our Team has not
                        laid out for you.

                        All the cornerstones have been placed and the
                        building is on the make with the students leaving no stones
                        unturned to improve and better the quality from the last time.
                        This is no normal fest, for we do not just conduct a fest,
                        we celebrate it here and it’s a ginormous celebration that is
                        bound to take your breath away.
